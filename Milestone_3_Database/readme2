Database Proposal

The Brogrammers have chosen MySQL as their database due to its versatility and simplicity. We believe that this database control method will offer sufficient dependability, feature control, and scalability for our team's needs.
Iteration 1
The first iteration of our database has been manually populated with data sufficient for milestone 3. We are currently exploring possible options for online API's through which we can allow our tables to use publically-available recipe and ingredient data to build themselves.

Our database currently features three tables: 
Current_Inventory: a particular user’s current pantry or inventory.
Recipe_Consortium: a master list of some preloaded and frequently used Recipes for load balancing. Other recipes will be pulled from the API automatically otherwise
Grocery_List: similar to a wish list, this table contains groceries which the user inserts in order to remember to purchase them during their next shopping trip.
As mentioned before, each table has some pre-loaded/manually-entered data that will later be automatically propagated from a recipe API. The database isn’t currently our integral aspect of development, as it relies more heavily on user input than the foundation at which the platform operates. Some examples of suitable content for our database include recipes for sandwiches, various types of spaghetti with marinara sauce, an assortment of groceries, and various other goods for the Current_Inventory table.
