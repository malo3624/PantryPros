Description

According to the National Center for Education Statistics, there were approximately 12 million college students from the age of 18-24 in 2014. Young adults in this stage of life are still learning to live independently without the support of their parents; one of the most important skills they can learn in this situation is how to cook for themselves.
Pantry Pros will allow a user to put the groceries they have in their refrigerator or pantry into our database via our website. From here, an algorithm will interpret the items they put in and provide helpful information about these ingredients. This may include what meals the user can make, how many meals can be made with the current quantities, and how to make these meals via easy-to-follow recipes. Users will be able to filter recipes by a number of factors, such as complexity, price, and preparation time (e.g. making chicken parmesan is likely to be a far more involved, time-consuming process than making a peanut butter jelly sandwich). This will help these individuals learn proper cooking habits, budget their grocery shopping, and ultimately stand on their own two feet as independent adults.

Vision Statement

To help college-age adults improve their cooking habits and live independently in a healthy, economical fashion.

Motivation

Approximately 40 percent of food in the U.S. goes to waste; in the entire world, 1.3 billion tons of food gets lost or wasted each year.  With the Pantry Pros website, we want to minimize that food waste by making meals from the groceries that people already own. The ‘living off of ramen’ stereotype isn’t too far from the truth when it comes to college-age adults; by making sure to eat food that is in their refrigerator or pantry before it spoils, not only will these adults help mitigate waste, but they’ll save money in the process as well.

Risks

One of the risks that could potentially prevent our team from being successful is a lack of experience with databases and specific programming languages. Additionally, a lack of clear communication between team members could hinder our progress as we move forward. While it is important to be ambitious with our goals, we must also keep in mind that that these goals must be attainable and realistic, especially given our limited timeframe and busy school schedules.

Risk Mitigation Plan

The largest factor in our risk mitigation plan is communication. Regular meetings, whether in person or by other means, will be a large part of our success as a team. As stated in this document we’ve agreed to use Trello, Slack, Google Docs, and Github as our collaboration tools for this project. We will all go to class to learn the essential tools we will need to complete the project and, when needed, will go to office hours to get a better understanding of the material. To ensure that we meet our goals and milestones, we will first get a fundamental working piece of the the project before expanding its complexity, functionality, and features. 

Version Control

The Brogrammers have decided to use GitHub as our team’s version control, thanks to its convenience, ubiquity, and ease of use.

Software Development Methodology

We’ve decided to proceed with the Agile methodology. Our team believes this methodology best fits our team’s personality and lifestyle. Here’re some pros of the agile process that our team likes:

Agile is a quick iteration type of methodology and we will be working week by week at a quick pace so agile will be a good fit for our project
Transparency with the current progress of the project, both between clients and other personnel working on the project.
Agile has a predictable schedule, allowing us to mitigate our risks.
Allows for quick changes to be made to the project without hindering any previous planning made.
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
Working software is the principal measure of progress

Collaboration Tool

Our team has decided to use Slack as our collaboration tool. We’ve chosen it for its team-friendly features, such as multiple channels for various topics, and for its convenient archiving/search functionalities. Our team has also decided to use Trello as another collaboration tool. We will primarily utilize Trello’s ability to keep track of different tasks, assigned team members, and due dates throughout the project.
